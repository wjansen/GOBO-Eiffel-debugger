Expressions and expression lists entered are checked for correctness. 
Any expression is first checked for syntactic correctness 
(balancing parentheses etc.) then for consistence of its constituents. 
Depending of the context this is done in one of two ways.
In any case, the context provides a class or type and, possibly, 
a routine of that class or type. 
</p><dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description">
<span style="font-weight:bold">Lazy compution</span></dt><dd class="dd-description"> 
The type, if given, is only used to provide the class. 
The first target of a qualified expression 
may be a query of the given class or (if also a routine is provided) 
it may be an argument or local variable of the routine. 
Any forthcoming fields in the qualified expression must be a query 
of the class of its target (the left neighbour), any polymorphism is ignored. 
<p>If the expression includes function calls the number of actual arguments 
must be the same as the number of formal arguments. 
The actual argument expressions are checked for correctness, too, 
and their declared type must conform to the formal arguments&#X2019; type. 
</p><p>The specification of alphanumeric feature names (not operators!) 
is relaxed so that only as many characters have to be entered 
as are necessary to make the name unique within its target class. 
Moreover, names attributes and local variables take precedence 
over the predefined entitues <span style="font-family:monospace">Current</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">Result</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">Void</span>, 
<span style="font-family:monospace">True</span>, <span style="font-family:monospace">False</span>. 
For example, if there is a unique attritube starting with &#X201C;t&#X201D; 
then entering just a &#X201C;t&#X201D; means this attribute, not <span style="font-family:monospace">True</span>. 
</p></dd><dt class="dt-description"><span style="font-weight:bold">Immediate evaluation</span></dt><dd class="dd-description">
Type and routine must be provided, additionally the address of an object
of this type (the object&#X2019;s dynamic type). 
Starting with the object as first target the expression is computed 
and at each stage of evaluation forthcoming fields of a qualified expression 
must be queries of the dynamic type of its (already computed) target. 
The other rules are as before with &#X201C;class&#X201D; and &#X201C;declared type&#X201D; 
replaced by &#X201C;type&#X201D; and &#X201C;dynamic type&#X201D;, respectively. 
</dd></dl><p>
The &#X201C;lazy evaluation&#X201D; is applied if the expression is specified now 
but computed later. A typical situation is the <span style="font-family:sans-serif">Print</span> option 
of a breakpoint: the expression is entered when the debuggee does not run 
and it is computed later during running when the breakpoint matches. 
In this case the address of an object (all the more its dynamic type) 
for immediate evaluation cannot be provided when the breakpoint is declared. 
An expression checked for lazy evaluation is checked again 
when it will be computed (of course, now for &#X201C;immediate evaluation&#X201D;). 
Finally, &#X201C;immediate evaluation&#X201D; is applied in the first place 
for expressions entered in the <span style="font-family:sans-serif">Expr</span> field of the <span style="font-family:sans-serif">Evaluation</span> part. 
Here, the shown stack level determines the routine and the type 
as the type of <span style="font-family:monospace">Current</span>.
